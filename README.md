# A-Guide-to-EDA-and-Data-Viz-in-Python

## Project Overview
This project explores the Chicago Park District Event Permits dataset, available from the City of Chicago's official website. The focus is on mastering Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) processes and employing Plotly for creating interactive visualizations, which could eventually be integrated into a dashboard hosted on a Jekyll webpage

## Methods and Tools Employed
* Data Acquisition: Utilizing APIs to fetch real-time data directly in JSON format, avoiding static files like CSV or Excel.
* Data Cleaning: Initial stages of data preparation to ensure quality and usability for analysis.
* Data Visualization: Utilizing Python's Plotly library to create interactive visualizations that provide insights into the dataset.
* Dashboard Creation: Plans to convert visualizations into a comprehensive dashboard.

## Learnings
* Data Cleaning Techniques: Gaining hands-on experience with techniques necessary for effective data analysis.
* Interactive Visualizations: Learning to use Plotly to make dynamic, interactive graphs that can update in real-time.
* APIs: Developing skills to use APIs for data acquisition, which offers flexibility and a deeper understanding of real-time data processing.

## Key Findings and Progress
* Employed basic trend analysis with line charts and comparison analysis using bar charts.
* Integrated API calls for data fetching, setting a foundation for real-time data analysis.
* Explored data to formulate potential event strategies for companies interested in hosting events at Chicago parks.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
* Implement the top 15 Pandas functions as outlined by Daniel Lee on LinkedIn to streamline modeling tasks.
* Transition from static to interactive visualizations using Plotly for enhanced user engagement.
* Develop a full-fledged dashboard to be hosted on a Jekyll site for broader accessibility.

## Request for Feedback
Please provide feedback on the data cleaning process and visualization techniques used. Your insights are valuable for refining the project and enhancing its outcomes.
